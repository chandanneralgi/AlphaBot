Developed by:

This gives 2 deployment options:
- Deploy within Flask app with jinja2 template
- Serve only the Flask prediction API. The used html and javascript files can be included in any Frontend application (with only a slight modification) and can run completely separate from the Flask App then.

## Initial Setup:
This repo currently contains the starter files.

Clone repo and create a virtual environment
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chandanneralgi/AlphaBot.git
